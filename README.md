Step 1: In your fork replace the Twitch channel name.

In the config.js of the beybot repo, you will need to replace my handle, "bdougieYO" with your Twitch handle.

The name is the thing you will need to change:

const twitchTvHandle = "bdougieYO";
If you do not have a Twitch account but would like to test this out, you can test this using my chat. I live-stream myself contributing and triaging open-source projects every Tuesday and Friday.
